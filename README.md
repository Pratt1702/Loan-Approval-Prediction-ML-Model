## About the Model

The loan prediction model is built using various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model takes several input features related to the applicant's financial status and personal information to predict whether a loan will be approved.

### Features Used in the Model

- **Married**: 0 for No, 1 for Yes
- **Dependents**: Number of dependents
- **Education**: 0 for Graduate, 1 for Not Graduate
- **ApplicantIncome**: Applicant's income
- **CoapplicantIncome**: Coapplicant's income
- **LoanAmount**: Loan amount in thousands
- **Loan_Amount_Term**: Term of loan in months
- **Credit_History**: 0 for no credit history, 1 for good credit history
- **Property_Area**: 0 for Rural, 1 for Semiurban, 2 for Urban
- **use_smote**: Boolean to indicate whether to use SMOTE for handling imbalanced data
- **model_name**: The machine learning model to use for prediction (LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, SVM)

## API Usage

To make a prediction, send a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with a JSON body containing the required fields.

### Example Input

Hereâ€™s an example of the JSON input you can send to the API:

```json
{
  "Married": 1,
  "Dependents": 0,
  "Education": 0,
  "ApplicantIncome": 5000,
  "CoapplicantIncome": 1500,
  "LoanAmount": 200,
  "Loan_Amount_Term": 360,
  "Credit_History": 1,
  "Property_Area": 2,
  "use_smote": true,
  "model_name": "LogisticRegression"
}
```

### Example Response

The API will return a JSON response indicating whether the loan is approved:

```json
{
  "approved": true
}
```
